# Weather App

A simple and responsive Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to check current weather conditions for any city worldwide by integrating with the OpenWeatherMap API. Key features include:

- Displays current temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and humidity.
- A clean, modern, and mobile-friendly design.
- Error handling for invalid locations or API failures.
- Dynamic background changes based on weather conditions.

This project is great for learning how to work with APIs and build interactive web applications.
